            <h4>Year Released: 1946</h4>
            <h5>Critical Reception: Praised as the finest American novel in more years than one would like to have to remember." <br>However, it was also criticized for for depicting a "depressing view of life" and "immoral situations"</h5>

         <p id="Introduction"><em>All the King's Men</em> portrays the dramatic and theatrical political rise and governorship of <strong>Willie Stark</strong>, an idealistic but underhanded populist in the 1930s American South. <br>The novel is narrated by Jack Burden, a political reporter who comes to work as Governor Stark's right-hand man. The trajectory of Stark's career is interwoven with Jack Burden's <br>life story and philosophical reflections: <span>"the story of Willie Stark and the story of Jack Burden are, in one sense, one story."</span></p>
